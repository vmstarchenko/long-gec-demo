<body><p>{"id": 4}<br/>Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue . Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so . In fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious . <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>"</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">PUNCT</span>⚠️</span></p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 15}<br/>Among all kinds of different diseases , a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons . Genetic disorder may or may not be hirataged hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases . It is a long time discussion that whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by gene . From the legal aspect , the answer is no but from the ethical aspect <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>,</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">PUNCT</span>⚠️</span> the answer should be yes .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 47}<br/>Besides that , the risk of the known genetic is very serious that it can not be described . The seriousness can be larger than our imagination . Lying on the bed for the remaining life , and even die immediately , these are the consequences which we can not imagine . Families are our dearest in our life . Without their concern and support , we are hard to stay until this time . They play the important role in our life which can not be substituted . A known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically . Therefore , it is our responsibility to tell the relatives <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>in order</span><span class="tooltiptext">OTHER</span>⚠️</span> to prevent the occurrence of undesired consequences .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 80}<br/>I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives . Genetic testing is a personal choice . One should have the full control of his / her information and it is <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>/</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">PUNCT</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> right to decide whether or not to disclose it to some one else .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 91}<br/>To tell or not to tell <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>?</span><span class="tooltiptext">PUNCT</span>✅</span></p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 196}<br/>Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy . People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments . That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what actually is happening around them . One of the examples is the 2012 riots happened in Egypt and Zambia . The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media . However , as the government controls most of the media . These social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public . For example , in 2012 general election is Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public . Though because of this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>on</span><span class="tooltiptext">PREP</span>⚠️</span> compared to other traditional medias .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 224}<br/>The advantage and disadvantage of social media <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>.</span><span class="tooltiptext">PUNCT</span>⚠️</span></p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 249}<br/>Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness . A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crimes and deception . People can use the information to deceive family and friends and banks <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>and</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft and so on .</p><body/>
