<body><p>{"id": 26}<br/>A person with a disorder , regardless of mental or physical disorder , is always easy to be awared by his or her families . When things come to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore . Genetic disorder inheritance is generation by generation , but not all of the offsprings show the relevant symptoms . Sometimes a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms . As a result , in the case that when one of the members happen to feel uncomfortable or unnormal , he or she should aware that whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not . Afterward , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is to reveal the problem to <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> relatives or not .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 31}<br/>For every action there is always pros and cons . I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them . Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family . I could understand the feeling of the carrier . She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in thefamily . However , we will never know whether this negative effects will happen when the carrier decide to tell his or her family of the <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> condition .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 34}<br/>Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory . Of course , some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier , however , the carrier , before the testing , can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts . If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds and willing to accept it , he could do that , and it has been something that is ' normal ' to everyone in the past as gentic testing was not possible . It could rather be better for <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>him</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">PRON</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>them</span><span class="tooltiptext">PRON</span></span> this way .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 39}<br/>Debates have been around for years , that should a carrier for a known genetic risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives . Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be informed to others , especially close family or relatives , is the topic that worth discussing . This is an issue need to be addressed as family - related ethical dilemma is involved . In this essay , few arguments will be pointed out in the support of view for any carrier of that known genetic risk to tell <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> relatives .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 48}<br/>Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's families without the agreement of carrier . It is the ethic of staff in hospital to keep the secret of any patients . We can not blame them that they are liable to the undesired consequences . However , hospital can provide a councilor to advice the carrier about the action can be taken . Therefore , this kind of circumstances will not be happened again and again . It is a method that benefits two parties which <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>and</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> is a win - win situation .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 50}<br/>With the risk of being genetically disorder , many individuals have done the decision to undergo genetic testing . With the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier face an ethical problem : They should warn their relatives about the risking of being the same genetic risk carrier . Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed . In the view of my point , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> relatives , with the support of the following reasons .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 57}<br/>Secondly , genetic diseases costs highly for the treatment and medication . Albinism is one of the examples . The people with albinism have sensitive skin and it needs regular treatment . Unlike people with high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism is prone to sunburn and other skin diseases . If they do n't treat their body well , such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen in outdoor , the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer . Once you suffer from cancer , the medication cost is very expensive . To prevent the bigger problem to happen , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body . If the carrier does n't tell <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 60}<br/>In this modern world , the technologies were improved a lot compared with the last century . Particularly , in the medical field , there is a great improvement in many treatments for many formally incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods which were used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder . The medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing . However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family - related ethical dilemma is born . The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> relatives .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 71}<br/>Being in Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease . The courage to take the genetic testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental while actually it is just a risk and not a confirmed case . Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with . Nevertheless , while I fell that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> potential partner ( husband or wife ) since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 85}<br/>In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> relatives .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 86}<br/>Carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> relatives</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 101}<br/>Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do a genetic testing . We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem . However , I thought that the genetic information is one person 's personal privacy which should be protected by the law . Therefore , I thought a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> family or relatives . There are three reasons as follows .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 102}<br/>Firstly , the information concerning to the genetic is something personally which is also a privacy like people 's bank card key . Other people should not be told without the person 's permission even though they are his or her family or relatives . The government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy . Once people 's genetic information is told to other people . They may know the person 's potential disabled disease or other bad things naturally . They may set a bias on this person even abandon his or her . People do not have the ability to choose their gene , they should not be thought badly because of bad gene . So I think whatever the genetic is or whether the gene is match with their parents , it should not be told to anyone even <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> family or relatives .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 103}<br/>Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family even broken the relation between children with the adult . Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them . However happy they were before , there would be some barrier appears which will truly destroy the family gradually . The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested only in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper and tighter . The parents give knowledge and love to the children , meanwhile they feel happy with the accompany of the children . The children rely the parent to live . When they grow up , they take care of the old parents and thank for their dedication . The relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication . Everyone does not want to see the scene of the broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk . Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> family or relatives without the person 's permission .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 104}<br/>Finally , the technology of testing the gene is not very mature now . There also exists some probability of wrong testing . If the wrong testing was not found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for their whole life . Therefore I think a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> family or relatives .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 105}<br/>Therefore , considering the people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> family or relatives without the person 's permission .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 106}<br/>A Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>His</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>Her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> Relatives</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 107}<br/>More and more illness are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of the medical technology . People will know about whether they carry a disease on their genes after they have done the genetic test . If there is no problem , that will be wonderful . However , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any disease genes . Therefore , once people find they have carried the disease genes , they should be responsible to tell their relatives , <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>or</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> at least their family members .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 109}<br/>If the person tell their relatives that he or she carries a disease gene , his or her relatives can go to hospital to check whether they also get a disease gene . Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease to occur . Also they can prevent the disease going to their offspring . If the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help , they will also teach <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>him</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">PRON</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>them</span><span class="tooltiptext">PRON</span></span> how to communicate with others about this issue .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 139}<br/>Above all , social network site is like a two sided knife and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding the possible disadvantages of it such as put less personal information on <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>his</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>or</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>her</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>their</span><span class="tooltiptext">DET</span></span> facebook page .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 158}<br/>Another problem with social media is that , the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not relfected as something positive to the users . The reason why it is so addictive is , that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends . However , such sparks of sudden attention is extremely short - termed and gone eaily thus does not add any value or meaning to the user 's life . Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>and</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives . But seriously , most people only post the happiest moments in their lives .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 165}<br/>In a nutshell , every sword has two edges . The users of every social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one . We should maximize the benefits of such platforms but be careful of its impacts on the actual life that we have . Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face - to - face meetings <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>but</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> social media sites are only the tools to enhance it .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 228}<br/>In conclusion , the showing up of social media sites is a double edged sword . It can make our life simpler . People can promote their friendship and relationship through these social media . Whereas , it can also make people forget to communicate to their family and friends in the real life and affect negatively to their interpersonal skills . But overall , the advantages far outweigh its disadvantage . So we need to make best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring . And try to bypass the shortcomings . <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>Remember</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>We should remember</span><span class="tooltiptext">OTHER</span>⚠️</span> to send greetings to our friends and family frequently .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 240}<br/>The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others by social media . If there is no social media , it is difficult for people to know about a stranger . They may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues or family members . And the information collected may not be intact and true . Unlike today , with the help with social media , people can easily get the information they want just by searching on line , and know about what that person did everyday <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>and</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> at what time .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 249}<br/>Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness . A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crimes and deception . People can use the information to deceive family and friends and banks <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>and</span><span class="tooltiptext">CONJ</span>⚠️</span> to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft and so on .</p><body/>
