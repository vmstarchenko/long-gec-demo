<body><p>{"id": 70}<br/>Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support . Without the support of loved ones , patients ' life is no better than death . Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder . A study of New York University in 2010 shown that patients with family members around generally recovers 2 - 4 days faster than those taken care by professional nurses . Even for those patients with terminal diseases , the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to the family support . Some people may say that telling the truth may arise some unnecessary doubts and panics which will endanger the family harmony . While every family need to go through this or that kind of troublesome situations , the more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding . Hence , for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other , all these troubles are just testaments to make them stronger . Just as the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson , what does n't kill you <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>make</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>makes</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:SVA</span>✅</span> you stronger .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 72}<br/>Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will most likely to judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or ' weird ' . This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble - Boy disease , autism or down - syndrome . In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases . While we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it . In this particular case , we are discussing about whether a person should tell his relatives about him having a RISK of a particular genetic disease . It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently . Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word ' risk ' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease . To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently . Especially when it is just a risk , the option is really his since he <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>is</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>are</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:SVA</span>⚠️</span> not an actual sufferer .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 82}<br/>The most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases . They have the right to know whether they are at risk . Also , telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing . They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease . If person has a disease C that might be a result of gene A. He runs a test and know that he has the gene AA . This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa . This means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved . His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can some how be prevented , to stop this disease from taking their lives . However , this can also be achieved from personal choice . One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk . Most people care about their relatives , if there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful . One might also choose to hint or encourage their certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>comes</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>may</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB</span>✅</span> <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:pink;font-weight:bold;'>across</span>→<span style='color:lightblue;font-weight:bold;'>occur</span><span class="tooltiptext">OTHER</span></span> when they disclose their genetic results .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 147}<br/>Nowadays , people can even use their phone to read news and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world . People use Twitter to follow the artiste or celebrity they love and Facebook to see what is their friends ' recent activity . Nevertheless , they still can use phone to do normal call and message to contact . Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet . It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connect people globally . Several arguments have been made regarding the social media actually <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>have</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>having</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:FORM</span>✅</span> some inevitable disadvantages to people .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 148}<br/>People can only use electical devices to access internet . Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or internet . Generally people need they eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device . As a result , they will lose eyes to contact and hands to express their feeling to people nearby them , which means they have lost the tools they need for face - to - face contact communicating . This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays . A family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork . A group of friends having high tea in a café without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk but pressing on their display screen . The children nowadays do not know what is neighbourhood games and who is staying beside them , all they know is pressing icons on the screens . These are some concrete examples of how the socia media <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>reduce</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>reduces</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:SVA</span>✅</span> face - to - face human contact .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 151}<br/>In conclude , socia media benefits people in several ways but in the same time harms people . People should avoid the misuse of socia media and use it in the proper way . With the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>lives</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>live</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:SVA</span>⚠️</span> happily .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 169}<br/>However , there are two sides of stories always . Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face - to - face connection between human . Since ancient times , human interact with others face by face . Without the facial impression , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers . That is why facial impression <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>is</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>are</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:SVA</span>⚠️</span> one of the most important elements in social learning .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 185}<br/>One of the advantages which are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before . In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter . However , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost , and sending a letter to a person who live far away , especially in villages , takes much time . The appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved . People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach . Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>provides</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>provide</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:SVA</span>⚠️</span> convenience for many people .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 218}<br/>How <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>do</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>does</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:SVA</span>⚠️</span> social media help change our lives ?</p><body/>
