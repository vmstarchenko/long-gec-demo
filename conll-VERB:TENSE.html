<body><p>{"id": 8}<br/>Sometimes some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication . Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from : the son or daughter for example , the parents who knows about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being ' allowed ' to tell . For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , either adult at risk . In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they not want to know . Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>needed</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>need</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:TENSE</span>⚠️</span> to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 28}<br/>In China , the older generation with traditional culture background , will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to make the family liven up and stronger . The reason behind is that after WOWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encourage the people to give more birth . During that period , if one of the family member reflects genetic disorder symptoms , he will fell in an ethical dilenma for sure . The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him . He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperity with a potential generic risk . And so , he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be mined forever . This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by the others because they <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>will</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>do</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:TENSE</span>⚠️</span> not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 45}<br/>Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : " I will be anxious about my families when he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of a known genetic risk " . Frequently , the intention of the carriers does not want to tell their families are to continue their own life without the anxious of families . It is obvious that there <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>will be</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>is</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:TENSE</span>✅</span> better for one person to be worried than many .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 65}<br/>As it is a genetic risk , the patient next - of - skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk , hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur . For example , if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately , you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child , hence by letting your family members aware of the situation , it would lessen family stresses and suffering on forcing you to settle down and have children . However , social ethic issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients relatives . It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles . Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996(HIPAA ) in the United States , there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives , it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members . Early disclosement to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention , as in the case of Angelina Jolie , she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent . I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>does</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>did</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:TENSE</span>✅</span> not want to live under the shadow of cancer .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 99}<br/>Secondly , it can avoid genetic disease passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies . They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage . They need to ask for doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby . Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary . If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease . I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago . A couple in China have a son of 5 years old . Their son unfortunately fell ill and he was diagnosis a kind of genetic disease which is very serious . They were told that the wife 's family was carrying the polygenetic disorder and can pass only to boys rather than girls . Therefore their son was inherited the genetic disease . However , the wife actually had already known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband . The son was died after one year 's treatment and the couple got divorced later after that . If the wife had not hind the truth and asked for doctor 's advice before they have baby , the tragic would not <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>happen</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>have happened</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:TENSE</span>✅</span> .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 123}<br/>Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience . To some extent , this makes our life more luxry and blundering . For myself , I am long to some places after I saw those beatiful pictures taken by my firneds . Sometimes I even canoot sleep well because of excitement . Social media makes our life patten so fast and <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>left</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>leaves</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:TENSE</span>✅</span> us less time to think about our life .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 129}<br/>It is also entire incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skill . Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences amongst people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skills on its own - some has it , some does not . Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance of utilising tests , and ranked . Fundamentally , those who scored lower ranking for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>is</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>was</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:TENSE</span>⚠️</span> needed .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 130}<br/>Though social media need not be necessarily bad , it must be used accordingly - for work , family , friends . The types of use must also be taken note of - informing , interacting , discussion and others . The space of separation between the parties must also be looked at . For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use social media is justified . For those who lives within the community should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of communcation with each other . And at the same time , improves the interpersonal skill , through dynamic practises betwwen individuals and realtime presence . The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>could</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>can</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:TENSE</span>⚠️</span> also bring a better rapport between those interacting .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 164}<br/>Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that falls us apart . The obvious disadvantage of using social media is that the time reduction on face - to - face contact . This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle . For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " . In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday . We used to send wishes cards during festive season like Chinese New Year , and we feel so good to write one and of course to receive one with stamps on it . Gone were the times , and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes . As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>needs</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>may need</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:TENSE</span>⚠️</span> to be redefined .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 177}<br/>In the sophisticated era like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier . Geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies were enhanced continuously . Telephone may be perceived as a big innovation created ever when the first time Graham Bell introduced it . However , since internet were known , telephone <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>∅</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>have</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:TENSE</span>✅</span> started to give way to social media sites .</p>================================================================================<br/><p>{"id": 205}<br/>Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship . People get connected or closer with same preferences . It is easier for people to approach the other after knowing the information . Students can exchange their experiences in study even they are in different countries . People are able to share the culture or pretty photos online , therefore others can spread the joy with them . Thus I believe that social media sites are one of useful tool to help people <span class="tooltip"><span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>known</span>→<span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>get to know</span><span class="tooltiptext">VERB:FORM</span>✅</span> each other better .</p><body/>
